#Postgres Express React Nodejs To Do List

so I basically wanted to use this project to create and practice with user logins authentication authorization and a bunch of other things like passkeys and sessions and using different kinds of tools to make a to do application that will notify users of their tasks and projects so that they can fulfill their deadlines. Which is ironic since I gave myself a deadline of two weeks but I failed miserably because I underestimated how long debugging and refactoring and implementing new tools would be. And thus I feel as if I failed my goal, nonetheless I learned alot while working on this application, I have a fairly long way to go til I feel as if I have a fully sound and complete understandinig full stack web development, I can create basic RESTful apis and apis in general but I lack a clear goal and need more experience with designing a full application from start to finish, and I need to get more comfortable with coding the backend and connecting to the database and configuring all the data. 
I created this uncomplete application as a novice full stack developer, I aim to come back to this project and complete it after I have practiced more with postgres, express, the new react router v7 which I will be using tsx to write code instead of jsx. And I aim to be get better at using oauth2 and jwt and sequelize and creating sessions and using cookies, I learned to use all of these tools in this project so its understandable that I wouldnt make a masterpiece but I refuse to leave this application in this state after weeks months or years even Ill continue to work on this and make it the best as I can.
So for my first attempt at a full stack project on my own with no guidance and only occasionally looking at stackflow and google for help I have created a rough template of a to do list application with a half way decent backend and a uncomplete front end.
